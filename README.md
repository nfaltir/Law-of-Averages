Law of Large Numbers ⚖️
=========================================

Overview
-----------------

In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers#cite_note-:0-1">Wikki</a>)
