Law of Large Numbers or Law of Averages
=========================================



User input
------------------------------------
1. enter the number of randomized coin tosses


Output
----------------
1. gives number of heads
2. gives number of tails
3. The script will also auto generate a graph, that shows the results


Experiment
------------------
I did a 100,000 random coin tosses. 

<h5>Results</h5>


Count of tails: 50068 
Count of heads: 49932

Tails: 50.07%
Heads: 49.93%


<h5>Issue</h5>

Total script run time: ~2min 39 sec

I think 2+ mins was too long. We will need to opitmize the code 
Next objective: write a recrusive alogthrim (memoization) to dramatically decrease the run time to seconds.
